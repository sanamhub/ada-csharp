Use it as a final pass on anything already written. Trigger on "write the docs", "update the README", "commit this", "open a PR", "add comments", or any request that produces text a human will read.

# Writing style

Everything written here has to read like an engineer wrote it. Not a model.

## Hard rules

1. **No em dashes.** Use a period, a comma, parentheses, or a colon.
2. **No AI filler.** Banned outright: delve, leverage (as a verb), seamless, robust,
   comprehensive, cutting-edge, best-in-class, game-changing, unlock, empower, foster,
   navigate (figurative), realm, landscape, tapestry, "it's worth noting", "it's important to
   note", "in today's world", "at the end of the day".
3. **No closing summary that restates the section.** Stop when the point is made.
4. **No duplication.** If a fact appears in two places, one of them links to the other.
5. **Short paragraphs.** Three or four sentences. Break anything longer.
6. **Plain words.** "fix" not "implement a solution for". "use" not "utilise". "so" not
   "thereby". "start" not "commence".
7. **No hedging stacks.** Pick one: "probably", not "it may potentially be possible that".
8. **No triads for rhythm.** Three items only when there are genuinely three.

## Commits and PRs

- Conventional Commits: `type(scope): summary`. Types: feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, test,
  build, ci, perf.
- Summary in the imperative, lower case, no trailing period, under 72 characters.
- Body explains why, not what. The diff already says what.
- **Never add `Co-Authored-By`, `Generated with`, or any other AI attribution.**

Good:

```
feat(interop): bind ada_parse and ada_free

Uses byte* and nuint so the signature stays blittable and the source
generator emits no marshalling stub.
```

Bad:

```
feat: 🚀 Implement comprehensive P/Invoke bindings

This commit leverages cutting-edge techniques to seamlessly integrate...

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## Code comments

Comment why, not what. If the code needs a comment to say what it does, rename something.

Good:

```csharp
// Ada returns a borrowed pointer. It dangles after any setter, so copy before mutating.
```

Bad:

```csharp
// This method gets the href from the URL object and returns it to the caller.
```

XML docs on public members are required. Say what the member does, what it returns, and what
breaks it. Skip the marketing.

## Docs and README

- Lead with what the thing is and who it is for. No throat clearing.
- State limits honestly and early. A README that hides a limit costs more trust than the limit does.
- Tables for facts. Prose for reasoning.
- Code samples must compile. If they cannot yet, say so.

## Final pass

Read it back and cut:

- Every em dash.
- Every sentence that could be deleted without losing information.
- Every word from the banned list.
- Every paragraph over four sentences.
- Every restatement of something said above.

If a section survives the cut unchanged, it was probably already fine.
